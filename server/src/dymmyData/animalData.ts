      'Though they bear a strikingly similar resemblance to their parent breed, the Persian, the exotic is evidently more popular, likely due to its low-maintenance mane. Minimal upkeep is required to keep these felines looking—and feeling—fancy. When it comes to grooming, one brush through weekly should do the trick, Keiger says.',

But bear in mind these birds don't move past the maturity of a 5-year-old for their entire lifespan of around 50 years or more. A bored, unattended African grey can quickly become a destructive escape artist. Because of the bird's intellect, many caretakers constantly have to find new ways to keep their pets occupied.`,
